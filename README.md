# Material color hashing

Hash a string to a Material Design color

A dead-simple library to hash a string to a {background-color, text-color} tuple from the official Material Design palette.

Great for dinamically coloring your UI elements (badges, list icons, ..) with good-looking, vibrant colors and ensured text legibility.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install material-color-hash
```
